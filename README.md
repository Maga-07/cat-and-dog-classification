# Training time reduction using cat and dog classification
Resize Images: Convert images to a smaller resolution (e.g., 128x128 or 256x256) to reduce the computational load without significantly compromising the model's accuracy.
Data Augmentation: Use efficient augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling to artificially increase the size of your dataset without needing to collect more data. However, avoid overly complex augmentations that add unnecessary computation time.
Normalization: Normalize pixel values to a common scale (e.g., between 0 and 1) to improve convergence speed.
Choose a Lightweight Model: Start with a lightweight architecture like MobileNet, SqueezeNet, or EfficientNet, which are designed to be efficient with fewer parameters.
Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet) with weights from ImageNet, fine-tuning only the top layers. This drastically reduces the amount of time needed for training from scratch.
Pruning: Prune redundant neurons or filters in your neural network, reducing the model size and training time while maintaining accuracy.
